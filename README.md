# SEAtoPDX
I'm moving to Portland, OR in January! 
I've gotten a whole range of reactions, but most importantly, I've gotten a lot of jokes, jabs, and advice about moving from Seattle. In the spirit of sharing this with the world (and having a reference for when I actually move), please chime in!

## Jokes, Jabs, Warnings (?)
_Laughter is medicine and life's too short to take things too seriously_
* Here’s a tip for you when speaking to the locals:

  Vancouver = Vancouver, British Columbia, ‘The Couve’ = Vancouver, Washington
  
* Have you watched [Portlandia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1780441/) TV show? Check if out so you are ready for Portland
* Enjoy the life in Portland for tax free shopping 
* Watch Short Circuit [- shot in Oregon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23_642IALG8)
